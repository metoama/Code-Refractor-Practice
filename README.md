# Code-Refractor-Practice  

## Description

This practice project was used to demonstrate potential future employment practice. I was given code to an already functioning website and tasked with making the codebase more accessible so that it would be optimized for search engines. 

## Usage

This will be used as a reference to proper execution of HTML semantics and consolidating CSS attributes.
